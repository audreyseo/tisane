Therefore, a p-value of less than 0.05 is considered to reject the null hypothesis, i.e., the data does not seem to be normally distributed. P-values of more than or equal to 0.05 however do not mean that the data is definitely sampled from a normal distribution. For more information on these tests, as well as documentation on their implementations, please click on the links in the table header."
