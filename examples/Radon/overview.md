The supplementary material include [data and scripts](www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/software/). More data and information about the data is provided [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/). 

Locally, the dataset (used in Chapter 13) is available [here](). Note, the dataset used in Chapter 13 and in this example includes only a limited number of variables (columns), but all the observations (rows), provided in the original dataset. 

## Summary of study design
The data comes from an observational study. 
There are are 919 households from 85 counties across the U.S. 
Each household provides one measure of radon, including where the radon measurement was taken in the house (e.g., floor). 
Geographic information about the households, including zip code and U.S. county of location, is also available. 

## Original data analysis 
In Chapter 13, Gelman and Hill analyze the data using a household-level variable (floor of radon measurement) and a county-level measure of uranium.
